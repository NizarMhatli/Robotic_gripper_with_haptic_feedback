# Objective: 


In order to improve the grasping process of the robotiq gripper plus the touchence sensors , we created this package that contains a code 
to test the different aspects of the grip process using the gripper and the sensor.

This package combines aspects from the previously created library to control the gripper and the sensor. 

The test process starts by increasing the position of the gripper slowly while checking the value of the sensor.
the position of the gripper will stop once an object is detected.
